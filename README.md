# bowling_kata 

This project solves the problem of calculating the score of a game of bowling.\
The basic description of the task can be found at\
http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

My solution exceeds the task by using an object oriented approach. 
Further it is possible to calculate intermediate scores, and using more than 10 frames is prohibited (you can add as many throws as you want, but scoring will stop at the 10th frame).\
Prior to the logic implementation, I used JUnit 5 to write various tests.
